A small pack of non-combat related fixes that aim to enhance the Devil May Cry 5 experience on the PC platform without requiring the use of additional executable files where possible - for the sake of convenience.

# Quality of Life Text Fixes

This mod fixes most, if not all text errors in the game, ranging from incorrect words in subtitles to fixes to Gallery description text.

# Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) Enabled

Allows you to use SSAO in normal gameplay at the cost of losing the Variable setting (disabled in gameplay, enabled in cutscenes - to maintain high performance in gameplay and high quality visuals in cutscenes). Only select this setting if you are after ambient occlusion in gameplay but can't quite hit your framerate target with HBAO+.
Side note, do NOT use HDAO. It is a terrible AO solution in DMC5 and can cause weird visuals and the performance cost is the same as HBAO+, a superior quality option.

# Subsurface Scattering Enabled

Allows you to enable Subsurface Scattering in gameplay while keeping it enabled in cutscenes at the cost of losing the Variable setting. Incredibly useful for higher quality screenshots!

# The Void: Visual Consistency Fix

This mod disables Screen Space Reflections (SSR) in the Void area. SSR is disabled in gameplay and as such for consistency reasons, I have disasbled it in the Void so that the game is more consistent with its visuals.

# Motion Blur & Screen Space Reflections

Alternative files allow you to enable Motion Blur and Screen Space Reflections, however are not available here at the moment. These will be added in the near future. They aren't available in the base mod because they have severe issues when the game is in motion/un-paused such as artifacting and ghosting.
