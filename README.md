A small pack of non-combat related fixes that aim to enhance the Devil May Cry 5 experience on the PC platform without requiring the use of additional executable files such as Cheat Engine or game trainers where possible - for the sake of convenience.

# What's Included

This mod includes fixes to the in-game text, such as typo fixes and including missing words in subtitles found in cutscenes or changing words to the correct word (e.g. "like" to "let" in the Kalina Ann II Gallery description). These fixes to the text are done keeping the intent of the developers in mind, knowing that if they caught the issues, they would have likely fixed them.

This mod changes the SSAO option to be enabled in both gameplay and cutscenes if SSAO if your selected ambient occlusion setting. This is at the loss of the Variable option. 

This mod changes the Subsurface Scattering setting to be enabled in both gameplay and cutscenes if set to ON, at the loss of the Variable option. Suggested use of this is if you would like to enhance your close-up screenshots of the playable characters.

Alternative files of this mod also allow Motion Blur and Screen Space Reflections in gameplay and cutscenes, however is not part of the base mod and not currently available here. These will be added in the near future.

# Installation

Install using Fluffy Mod Manager 5000. You can grab that here: https://fluffyquack.com/tools/modmanager.zip


# Notes

"Variable" is what allows the setting to be disabled in gameplay and enabled in cutscenes, to aid in delivering smooth performance during gameplay, while keeping the cutscenes high quality. This mod technically doesn't remove the setting but changes the setting by editing the lighting files themselves to enforce/allow these changes (such as enabling Subsurface Scattering in gameplay). If your system is struggling to play the game and you want this mod, you should delete the scene folder so that you may retain the Variable option and keep the text fixes.

Motion Blur and Screen Space Reflections are not included within the base mod file because they have issues with them such as artifacting and/or ghosting issues. These issues tend to lower the image quality in motion but are included in alternative files for those that may be able to put up with the issues or for screenshotting purposes.

I cannot add a setting that lets you change the rendering API between DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 while in-game instead of via dmc5config.ini.

I have not found a way to enable and disable Screen Space Contact Shadows at all, let alone per mission. For now, stick to the dmc5config.ini edit for these contact shadows. Please note this setting may result in buggy shadows in certain areas of the game, especially in Mission 01 and Mission 03 during certain sections - however these contact shadows can look great for screenshots in plenty of areas.

As a safetey precaution for those that may be wondering, no, I cannot force ray tracing to be enabled. Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition runs on an updated version of the RE Engine and the current version DMC5 uses does not support ray tracing. If CAPCOM release an update or DMC5SE on PC, I will attempt to update the mod if it breaks.
